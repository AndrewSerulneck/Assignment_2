    <p>Roberto Lopez, a retired tenant in Williamsburg, stood before the steps of City Hall on a cold November morning.</p>

    <p>He collected himself for a moment before addressing a crowd of demonstrators. Many of those in the attendance were carrying signs with slogans like “Just Say ‘No!!’ to the City of Yes!”</p>
    
    <p>Unlike most of the speakers that morning, Roberto did not bring notes to help him recall what he wanted to say – he didn’t need them.</p>
    
    <p>“Talk about lies and broken promises,” he shouted, pointing both his hands in the air. “In 2005, we went through a huge rezoning along the waterfront from Greenpoint all the way into Queens.”</p>

    <p>Boo’s and jeers erupted from the crowd. He pressed on, using their outrage as a metronome for his growing fury.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        “When I ask around the neighborhood, ‘did you get an apartment in these so-called lotteries?’ Guess what they say! ‘No!’ They didn’t get these apartments. And they’re never gonna get these apartments in these lotteries! That’s because it was all a … what?” Roberto gestured to the crowd behind him.
        <br><br>
        “Big lie!” they shouted in unison.

    <p>As New York City grapples with an ever-increasing housing crisis, Mayor Eric Adams’ "City of Yes" plan seeks to expand access to affordable housing by relaxing zoning ordinances and allowing developers to build multi-unit housing in areas that previously would not have allowed for it, including parts of Brooklyn and Queens currently restricted to one or two-family homes.</p>

    <p>According to NYC Open Data, these areas have <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Database/6umk-irkx/about_data" target="_blank"> aggressively resisted efforts</a> by developers to increase the amount of housing available for years. Since 2010, Queens has seen a significant drop off in the amount of residential construction permits being approved. These outer borough areas have also become the epicenter of resistance to the proposal.</p>

    <p>The City of Yes is based on a simple premise: when the amount of available housing goes up, rent prices should come down. But residents of Queens say this is a bait and switch they’ve seen before.</p>

    <p>“Long Island City has gained 30,000 housing units in the last 20 years,” says Paul Graziano, a Queens-based community activist and urban planning consultant “And yet, the rent has gone up from $3400 a month to $5100 per month. Meanwhile, renters living in four, six, eight-unit buildings were displaced by developers who wanted to build luxury towers.”</p>

    <p>Since the early 2000’s, Hunters Point, Queens Plaza and Dutch Kills have all been transformed from industrial parks to ultra-chic neighborhoods. While this was happening, city planners eased concerns of gentrification by offering developers incentives to produce affordable units. They also implemented a lottery system that they claimed would allow low and middle income residents to remain in those areas.</p>

    <p>Things did not play out that way. The developments in Dutch Kills never produced a single unit of affordable housing. In other parts of Long Island City, residents found that they didn’t make enough money to move into the “affordable” units being built.</p>

    <p>“I’ve never liked the whole lottery system,” said Reverend Carlene O. Thorbs, adding that even if current residents are selected in the housing lotteries, the resulting increases in rent and property values make it impossible to stay long term. Critics of City of Yes say the plan will ultimately displace current residents. “These new developments already have their lists made up, and we’re not on them,” Thorbs lamented.</p>

    <p>Dan Garodnick, Chair of the New York City Planning Commission, has sought to assuage these fears, arguing that the "City of Yes" initiative is a modest yet necessary step to address New York’s housing challenges.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        “City of Yes grew out of the last administration’s 'Where We Live' fair housing report,” Garodnick said, “and is carefully crafted to respect the character of communities while ensuring that every neighborhood does its part to generate much-needed new housing.”
    </div>

    <p>When asked via email about New Yorkers’ lack of trust in city officials to address the underlying problems with housing affordability, Garodnick was sympathetic but firm in his position.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        “Inaction is not an option,” the former city councilman asserted. “New Yorkers feel the impact of our housing shortage every day. With a generational housing shortage and a rental vacancy rate of just 1.41%, many residents suffer from high rents, displacement, and homelessness, while homeownership feels increasingly unattainable.”
    </div>

    <p>Critics insist that this plan was not crafted with average New Yorkers in mind. "This is a plan written by developers for developers," says Paul Graziano. "More to the point, this is a plan written by developers who gave money to the Mayor, and we are the collateral damage."</p>
